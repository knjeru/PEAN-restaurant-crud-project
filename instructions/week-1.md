# Week One

Make sure to read through the entire document and Tracker Stories before starting so you know what you're doing! Ask questions before you leave class on Friday.


### Acceptance Criteria:

This week, you will be revisiting your skills from Unit 1 and implementing routing to get a basic gTables site up and running. You should have all the [Tracker Stories](../tracker-stories) from this week completed by EOD Sunday. In general, we will be looking for the following:

* A file structure exist and makes sense
* A `node_modules` folder is NOT pushed up to Github
* The Index, Show, New and Edit pages look similar to the mockups provided
  * Your "Show" and "Edit" pages will be generic -- that is, they will have an individual restaurant hardcoded
* Semantic HTML is used where appropriate
* CSS/SCSS is split into multiple files and well structured
* Routes exist to reach every above page
* The New page validates form input
